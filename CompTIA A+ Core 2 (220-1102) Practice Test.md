## Scoring and Grading Chart – Core 2

The CompTIA A+ Core 2 exam has a passing score of 700 (on a scale of 100–900), roughly equivalent to about **78%** of the questions answered correctly. Use the following chart to gauge your performance on this 90-question practice test:

|**Number Correct (out of 90)**|**Percentage**|**Evaluation**|
|---|---|---|
|82–90|91%–100%|Excellent (Well above passing)|
|72–81|80%–90%|Good (Above the recommended score)|
|**70**|**77.8%**|**Approximate Passing Threshold** (700 score)|
|64–69|71%–76%|Slightly below passing – review weak areas|
|63 or fewer|≤70%|Below Passing – additional study needed|

_On the real exam, a score of **700/900** is required to pass (around 78%). For a 90-question practice test, that corresponds to roughly **70/90** correct. Aim for **72/90** (80%) or higher on practice tests to build confidence for the actual exam._
