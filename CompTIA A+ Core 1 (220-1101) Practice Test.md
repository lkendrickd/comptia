## Scoring and Grading Chart – Core 1

For 90 questions, each question is worth approximately 1.11% of the exam. CompTIA A+ Core 1 requires a scaled score of 675 (on a scale of 100–900) to pass, which is roughly **75%** of the questions correct. Use the chart below to assess your performance:

|**Number Correct (out of 90)**|**Percentage**|**Evaluation**|
|---|---|---|
|82–90|91%–100%|Excellent (Well above passing)|
|72–81|80%–90%|Good (Comfortable pass level)|
|**68**|**75.5%**|**Approximate Passing Threshold** (675 score)|
|60–67|67%–74%|Below Passing (Needs improvement)|
|<60|<67%|Far below passing – significant additional study recommended|

_A score of **68/90** (approximately 75–76%) is about the minimum passing threshold for the real exam. It is recommended to aim for around 72/90 (80%) or higher on practice tests to be confident for the actual exam._
